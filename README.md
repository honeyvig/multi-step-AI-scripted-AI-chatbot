# multi-step-AI-scripted-AI-chatbot
Building an AI chatbot that follows multiple flows of a sales script, utilizes both free text and predefined messages, and includes a scoring system for responses is a comprehensive project. Below is an outline along with Python code to implement this functionality.
Key Components

    User Input Handling: Capture both predefined and free text responses.
    Natural Language Processing: Use NLP techniques to understand user inputs.
    Scoring System: Implement a scoring mechanism to evaluate the correctness of responses.
    Chatbot Flow: Define multiple flows based on the sales script.
    API Integration: Enable interaction with external services if needed.


Explanation of the Code

    Libraries:
        The transformers library from Hugging Face is used for conversational models.
        You might need to install it using pip install transformers.

    Sales Flows:
        sales_flows dictionary contains different flows of the sales script with various prompts.

    Predefined Responses:
        A dictionary to map common user responses for scoring.

    Scoring Function:
        score_response function checks how closely the user input matches expected responses.

    Chatbot Logic:
        The chatbot_flow function manages the conversation flow based on the current state (greeting, product info, closing).

    User Input:
        The chatbot captures user input and adjusts its responses based on the defined flow.

Future Enhancements

    Integrate an external API: For product availability or customer information.
    Advanced NLP techniques: Use a more sophisticated model for intent recognition.
    State Management: Implement a more robust state management system to handle various conversational contexts.
    User Feedback: Incorporate user feedback for continuous learning and improvement.

This is a basic implementation and can be expanded with more features such as logging, user profiles, or a database for storing interactions and user preferences.

Building an AI Chatbot for Sales: A Comprehensive Guide
Understanding the Task

We aim to build an AI chatbot that:

    Follows Multiple Sales Flows: The bot can navigate different conversation paths based on user input.
    Combines Free Text and Predefined Messages: It can generate natural language responses while also using pre-set messages for specific scenarios.
    Uses a Scoring System: To evaluate the bot's responses and improve its performance over time.
    Integrates with APIs: To access external data sources and services.

Technical Approach

1. Data Preparation and Model Training:

    Data Collection: Gather a dataset of sales conversations, including customer queries, agent responses, and relevant product information.
    Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, tokenize it, and create a vocabulary.
    Model Selection: Consider using a combination of neural networks and LLMs:
        Sequence-to-Sequence Models (Seq2Seq): For generating free text responses.
        Transformer-based Models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3): For understanding context and generating more coherent responses.
        Reinforcement Learning: To optimize the bot's decision-making process and reward effective responses.

2. Sales Flow Design:

    Create a Flowchart: Visualize the different paths a conversation can take.
    Define Decision Points: Identify points where the bot needs to make a decision based on user input.
    Assign Predefined Messages: Assign specific messages to certain decision points.

3. Scoring System:

    Human Evaluation: Have human experts rate the bot's responses on a scale of 1-5.
    Automated Metrics: Use metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR to evaluate the quality of generated responses.
    Reinforcement Learning: Use rewards and penalties to encourage the bot to make better decisions.

4. API Integration:

    Product Information: Integrate with a product information API to fetch real-time details.
    CRM Integration: Connect to a CRM system to access customer data and update records.
    Payment Gateway Integration: For processing payments.

Python Code Example:
Python

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the pre-trained model
model_name = "t5-base"
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

def generate_response(prompt):  


    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    output_ids = model.generate(input_ids)
    response = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response  



# Example usage
user_input = "I'm interested in your latest phone"
bot_response = generate_response(user_input)
print(bot_response)

Use code with caution.
Additional Considerations:

    Contextual Understanding: The bot should be able to maintain context throughout the conversation.
    Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected inputs.
    Continuous Learning: Continuously train the model on new data to improve its performance.
    Ethical Considerations: Ensure the bot's responses are ethical, unbiased, and respectful.
    User Experience: Design a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the power of AI, you can create a highly effective sales chatbot that can significantly improve customer interactions and drive sales.
